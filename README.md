```
In this example we approve the copy and paste
```

But edit with ur style the commands, this is so that it is not 100% copy and paste, even so we recommend not to use copy + paste, so that you better learn the development of Discord bots, it is your choice.

Download as .zip if u want.

If they are not good examples, well I try to do my best.

notify if there are translation errors, I am uruguayan and spanish is my native language.

```
I will update these examples when a new version of Discord.js comes out
